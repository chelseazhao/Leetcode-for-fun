60 Permutation Sequence

The set [1,2,3,…,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

    "123"
    "132"
    "213"
    "231"
    "312"
    "321"

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

思路：从高到低逐位确定：假设第m位是k，则k*(m-1)! <= n且n > (k-1)*(m-1)!
